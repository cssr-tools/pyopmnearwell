    This class is used for typing of abstract attributes of ``BaseUpscaler``. MyPy will
    check if subclasses of ``BaseUpscaler`` implement the following instance attributes:

    - ``num_xcells``
    - ``single_feature_shape``

    Note: As of now (Python 3.11), each instance method of ``BaseUpscaler`` or a
        subclass making use of one of the attributes, needs to have its self argumented
        annotated with ``Upscaler``. In future python versions it should be possible to

    coarse cell.

    timesteps/horizontal cells.
